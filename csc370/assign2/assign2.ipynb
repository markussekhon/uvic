    "$Customers(\\underline{SIN}, name, phone, addr)$ with the following FD: ($\\underline{SIN}\\rightarrow name, phone, addr $)  \n",
    "The reason I chose the relation to be like this is because the diagram had marked it to be made as such (entity had those attributes and keys).  \n",
    "The FD was made as SIN is a key, and it is how we can identify unique instances of our relation.  \n",
    "Semantically it makes sense as a relation and FD. You use customer's SIN, and store their other information along side it.  \n",
    "As a SIN is unique, it will help you identify unique instances of customers.  It could be entirely possible to find unqiue instances with name, addr, and phone together, or a subset of those attributes, but there is no solid guarantee. \n",
    "\n",
    "$Flights(\\underline{number},\\underline{day}, aircraft)$ with the following FD: ($\\underline{number \\; day} \\rightarrow aircraft$)  \n",
    "The reason I chose the relation to be like this is because the diagram had marked it to be made as such (entity had those attributes and keys).  \n",
    "The FD was made as number and day together is a key to find the aircraft that will be used.  \n",
    "Semantically it makes sense as a relation and FD.  \n",
    "You use flight numbers and the day of flight to find out which aircraft will be used. Usually a flight number will only be used once per day.  \n",
    "An aircraft could take multiple flights per day, and an aircraft and a flight number could be reused multiple for multiple different days.   \n",
    "All of this information together would describe flights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$Bookings(\\underline{SIN}, \\underline{number}, \\underline{day}, row, seat)$ with the following FD ($\\underline{SIN \\; number \\; day}\\rightarrow row, seat$)  \n",
    "This relation was a bit more tricky. The attributes row and seat were just given by glance at the E/R diagram.  \n",
    "The diagram also noted this was a weak entity, with supporting relations toCust and toFit. Each respectively for customers and flights.  \n",
    "I made the relations seperately and then absorbed them together in to bookings as individually all three were rather useless.  \n",
    "Individualy toCust provided instances of one customer and all their rows, seats with no indications of what flight those rows, seats belonged to - toFit provided the opposite, where it linked instances of one flight to all their rows, seats with no indications of what customers were supposed to go there.  \n",
    "Together, however, they filled each others gaps and rendered toCust and toFit redundant so they were removed. As the entity was noted as a weak entity, its keys came from the relations.   \n",
    "Semantically, we have row, seats being uniquely specified by one customer and one flight (together, not seperately). So it makes sense.  "
