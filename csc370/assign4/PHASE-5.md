# PHASE 5

## Expenses

The idea is simple. You can add, update, or view expenses.

### Add Expenses

You tell the amount, campaignid, and reason for the expense, and it adds it to the table

### Update Expenses

You tell the id, and add the new amount and reason

### View Expenses

You see all the expenses of a campaign, and then a view of all the expenses as well!

:) simple but non-trivial I would say!!!
