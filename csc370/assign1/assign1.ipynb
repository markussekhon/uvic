    "\n",
    "In order to reduce confusion and errors as you prepare answers, for this assignment you are to use the rename operation (i.e. $\\rho$) in a notation similar to that used for $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$. For instance, the `Sells` relation described in the lectures has attributes `pub`, `beer`, and `price`. If we want to create a new relations `S'` where the attribute `pub` is now called `name`, you can write either:\n",
    "$$ S' = \\rho_{name, beer, price}(Sells) $$\n",
    "or:\n",
    "$$ S' = \\rho_{name / pub}(Sells)$$\n",

    "```all resulting closures require``` $I\\wedge S$ ``` and to put it another way, all resulting superkeys require``` $I\\wedge S$\n",
    "\n",
    "```The only key is``` $IS$ ``` and that is because its closure results in all attributes in the relation Equities, so it is a superkey. Further, we know it is a key (candidate key) because if we removed any parts of it, it would no longer result in the superkey, which is by definition a key (candidate key). So, if we removed either ``` $I \\vee S$ ``` from ``` $IS$ ``` the remaining result's closure would not result in all attributes of the relation Equities.```\n",

    "**b) No FD can be removed (and still have a basis)**\n",

    "```Removing ``` $S\\rightarrow D$ ``` would cause``` $\\{S^+\\} = {S}$ ```which alters the closure as we cant get back ``` $D$  \n",

    "\n",
    "``` The only FD that has more than 1 attribute on the LHS is ``` $IS\\rightarrow Q$ ``` and we need both ``` $I \\wedge S$ ``` to determine ``` $Q$ ``` as removing either would result in us not being able to determine Q. ```  \n",

    "```For all the FDs that have 1 attribute on the LHS it is trivially true that their LHS can't be further reduced. ```  \n",
