    "I wanted to lead my portfolio this question because chatGPT has been my biggest supporter in all aspects of learning inside and outside of SENG265.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever I come across a concept that I don't quite understand, or feel that I am missing knowledge pre-requsite to the subject, I approach chatGPT as if it were my peer and interact with it. I personally have found that it makes many mistakes along the way, just as any peer might, and that has also helped me stay sharp as I know that mindlessly interacting with it would give back exectly what I put in.\n",

    "\n",
    "Outside of SENG265, I started to learn rust, and I have found it quite helpful in terms of explaining ownership, and other concepts of rust I have had difficulty with. This can be said about any concepts we discussed in class this semestes as well. If I ever needed to reinforce what was discussed in class, I would just have a casual conversation with chatGPT about it! For example, I wanted to know if was possible to create a memory leak in python - so I asked chatGPT and it went and drew me up an example rather quickly!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing of note is that I randomly had a great conversation with Hausi in the parking lot at UVic regarding chatGPT. Hausi told me about about how there was now a code interpereter built into chatGPT 4, as well as the ability to use plug-ins. When I got home, I enabled those tools as they were in beta, and  I found them to be really fun to play around with. Much of the plugins were very clunky and they also reduced the accuracy of chatGPT - still, I have still found them useful from time-to-time. Just recently I was trying to explain a concept to a friend and it required using your visual intuition and imagation quite a bit - so I turned to chatGPT and used the diagram plug-in in order to create a plugin. Sure, I could have just drawn it myself, but I wouldnt have been able to do it so quickly, nor could have I done it as neatly.\n",

Its not that I didnt like windows, I just didnt find it fun to use cmd/powershell and having to code in the windows environment, and I didnt game that much anymore. So when I made the switch to linux I loved it. I felt less afraid because of learning bash formally, even though it wasnt that much of a deep dive into it.\n",
